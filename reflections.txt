I have learned some more HTML tags that I can use while developing sites. I would say learning how to accomplish desired designs using HTML has been easy. One thing I find a little challenging still is knowing the best place to put some of the semantic HTML tags. Whenever I encounter something I don’t know I don’t give up and just research it until I am able to find the solution I want.
